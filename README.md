# Even Simpler Tile Model
This is a project written in Go to implement a Even Simpler Tile Model which utilises wave function collapse.

Build with `go build` and run with `./even-simpler-tiled-model`.

The sample input is hard coded but you can play around with the sample input to generate different results.
