# Even Simpler Tile Model
This is a project written in Go to implement a Even Simpler Tile Model which utilises wave function collapse.

Build with `go build` and run with `./even-simpler-tiled-model`.

The sample input is hard coded but you can play around with the rules to generate different results. Currently no entropy function is built and it works on a left to right basis.

TODO: Build the entropy function so that is decides the next tile to collapse based on weights which are calculated by the sample input.
